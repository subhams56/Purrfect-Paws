# Purrfect Paws üêæ

I built this website as a learning experience for me, where I used a variety of technologies such as React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Icons, JavaScript, and react-typed. 

The main focus of this project was to dive into the world of Tailwind CSS and improve my skills in building a visually appealing website. It is not a fully functional site and is only meant to be used as a demonstration of Tailwind CSS.

## What I learned
- How to use Tailwind CSS to style a React project
- How to implement dynamic animations using react-typed
- How to use React Icons for a more visually appealing interface
